git reset
	This will unstage all files you might have staged with git add:

git checkout
	This will revert all local uncommitted changes (should be executed in repo root):

git checkout [some_dir|file.txt]
	You can also revert uncommitted changes only to particular file or directory:

git reset --hard HEAD
	Yet another way to revert all uncommitted changes (longer to type, but works from any subdirectory): 

git clean -fdx
	This will remove all local untracked files, so only git tracked files remain:

WARNING: -x will also remove all ignored files!
